The resilience of socio-ecological systems is enhanced by levels of human well-being which reduce vulnerabilities and promote effective learning responses to change and uncertainty. As an important element of well-being, health serves as a useful proxy for resilience. Human skeletal remains from archaeological contexts can be used to extend the time-depth of our understanding of adaptive cycles. We assess health in human skeletal remains from three sites in the early modern Ryukyu Islands (17th-19th centuries) using four health markers (enamel hypoplasia, dental calculus, dental attrition, cribra orbitalia). We examine variation across Ryukyu to assess resilience during a period of considerable socio-ecological change caused by colonial control of the Ryukyus by the Satsuma domain of southern Japan. Significant site differences were detected for dental attrition (highest at remote Nagabaka, p<0.001) and cribra orbitalia (lowest at Kanna, p=0.006). These patterns suggest that distance from centers of political control may have promoted resilience through retention of cultural autonomy and food security, though sex-based differences in health at Nagabaka indicate potential gender-based economic specialization under colonial taxation systems.
