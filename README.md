## Resilience and Health in Colonial Ryukyu Islands

Bioarchaeological analysis of skeletal health markers from three burial sites in colonial-era Okinawa (17th--19th centuries) tests whether distance from Japanese colonial centers shaped health outcomes differently across geography and sex. Generalized Linear Models fit to four health markers -- enamel hypoplasia, dental calculus, dental attrition, and cribra orbitalia -- reveal that remote sites showed elevated dental attrition but lower anemia than the port city, and that a significant sex-by-site interaction at the most distant site points to gender-differentiated colonial labor demands as a mechanism for divergent health profiles within the same community.
