This project examines how Japanese colonial control (1609-1879) affected health and resilience across the Ryukyu Islands (modern-day Okinawa). Using skeletal remains from three archaeological sites, we investigate whether distance from political centers influenced health outcomes and whether men and women experienced colonialism differently.

Key Finding: Remote communities showed different health patterns than the port city, suggesting distance from colonial control may have provided some protection through retained cultural autonomy.
